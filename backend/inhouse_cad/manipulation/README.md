# Manipulation Module

This folder is reserved for server-side mesh manipulation features (Explode, Measure, Transform).
Currently, these features are implemented in the Frontend (Three.js) to provide real-time interactive feedback as per User Stories 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3.

Future backend implementations (e.g. valid B-Rep transformations using OCC) should reside here.
